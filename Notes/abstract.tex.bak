\begin{abstract}
Verification binaries are compact Galactic binaries with orbital periods of a few hours are gravitational wave sources in the mHz regime that are expected to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and other future GW detectors. One such candidate is the cataclysmic variable binary (AM CVn) \emph{HP Lib} consisting of a white dwarf accretor of mass and a brown dwarf  donor of mass with period hrs. Binary system parameters such as the inclination, orientation and distance are needed to provide an accurate prediction of the gravitational wave strain. A full gravitational wave polarisation prediction requires resolving the orientation of the binary orbit in the sky. We use the method of  spectropolarimetry to estimate the orientation of the binary HP Lib. We estimate that the light reflected from the brighter source will provide a good signal to noise ratio to resolve the polarization.
